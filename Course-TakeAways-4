Controller's Responsibilities
----------------------------------------
Setup initial state of $scope
Add behavior to $scope

Do not use controllers to handle business logic directly
Do not --------------- to Share code or data or state across controllers
Solution is Using Custom Service

.service('customService', CustomService); - Treats Function as Function Constructors
'customService' - used to inject in other services, controllers.
CustomService - function constructor
Uses only single instance, SINGLETON Design Pattern, So can easily share data between controllers

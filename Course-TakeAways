Expressions and Interpolation
---------------------------------------------------
{{}} - double braces, mustaches, handlebars call anything
Expressions : {{exp}}
Something that evaluates to a value
Processed by AngularJS and similar to eval(some_js) as in general JS
Diff:
1. Executed in context of scope and has access to properties defined in $scope
2. Doesn't throw errors if it results in TypeError or ReferenceError, just empty string returned
3. Also, unlike eval, control statements are not allowed inside expressions
4. Accept a filter or a filter chain to format the output.

Interpolation
-----------------------------------------------------
Process of evaluating a string and finding placeholders in it and replacing it with some values later
For ex: Hello {{name}} is interpolated to Hello Amar (message = Amar)
Still connected, so if message changes, output changes.

Filters In Angular JS
------------------------------------
var output = $filter('uppercase')(value);
value will be uppercased, 'uppercase is pre-defined filter'
1. creates filtering function
2. applies that function to value
3. Filter specific optional arguments
4. Direct use in HTML {{ value | uppercase}} or {{ "Hello" | uppercase}} or {{ "Hello" | uppercase : customarg :customarg}}

Custom Directives
---------------------------------------
Directive ?
A Directive is really just a Marker on a DOM element that tells Angular's HTML
compiler to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element. The compiler can
also transform/change the DOM elements and its children. The marker itself
as we're calling it can be one of four things, it can be and ATTRIBUTE, AND
ELEMENT NAME, a comment, and even a CSS class.

1. Register a Directive
.directive('myTag', myTag);
'myTag' - Normalized(CamelCased Name) name that will appear on HTML
myTag - Factory Function - returns DDO - DIRECTIVE DEFINITION OBJECT
executes only once, so perform initializations here, besides returning DDO

2. Define Factory Function
MyTag.$inject=[...]
function MyTag(...) {
var ddo = {
  template: 'Hello World';
};
return ddo;
}

3. Use in HTML
<my-tag></my-tag>
Normalized name - myTag

Restrict Property
------------------------------------
tells what angular compiler should look for to detect custom directive
var ddo = {
  restrict: 'AE' (Default: Attribute, Element)
  template: 'Hello World';
};
Best: Use E when directive has content along with behavior
Best: Use A when directive has no content but only extends the behavior of host element
